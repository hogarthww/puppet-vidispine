## Overview

The Vidispine module manages the installation and configuration of
[Vidispine](http://www.vidispine.com/).

## Module Description

Vidispine is a content management platform providing cataloguing, indexing,
searching, and transcoding of media assets via REST APIs.

The module supports installation of an instance of Vidispine in a Glassfish 
container, and configuration of the instance.

Because Vidispine stores its configuration in its database instead of in
config files, all configuration must be performed via the API. The module
defines custom types and providers representing configuration entities within
Vidispine, so that these configuration items can be managed as Puppet resources.

## Setup

### What vidispine affects

* Installs Oracle Glassfish 3 under `/opt/glassfish3`
* Downloads, unpacks, and runs the Vidispine installer under `/opt/installers`
* Creates a user account for Vidispine to run under
* Installs an init script to allow Vidispine to be controlled as a service
* Configures Vidispine via the configuration API

### Setup Requirements

This module depends on the following other modules:
* [hww-glassfish](https://github.hogarthww.prv/puppet/hww-glassfish) - this is
  a private fork of [fatmcgav-glassfish](https://github.com/fatmcgav/puppet-glassfish)
* [nanliu-staging](https://github.com/nanliu/puppet-staging)

Pluginsync must be enabled.

## Usage

The module is currently (August 2015) used in one place: the 
[zonza_vidispine](https://github.hogarthww.prv/puppet/zonza_vidispine) profile module.
This is the reference use case of this module.

### Install Vidispine

Instantiating the `vidispine` class should result in an installation. The list of
parameters to the `vidispine` class is very long, although most should not need
to deviate from defaults.

### Configure Vidispine

Configure a storage backend:

```
vidispine::storage {'storage1':
  ensure     => present,
  vshostname => 'localhost',
  vsport     => 8080,
  vsuser     => 'admin',
  vspass     => 'admin',
}

vidispine::storage_method {"auto-http://${::fqdn}:8080/storage1/":
  ensure     => present,
  storageuri => "http://${::fqdn}:8080/storage1/",
  vshostname => 'localhost',
  vsport     => 8080,
  vsuser     => 'admin',
  vspass     => 'admin',
  location   => "storage1",
  read       => 'true',
  write      => 'true',
  browse     => 'true',
  type       => 'AUTO',
  require    => Vidispine::Storage['storage1'],
}
```

Connect a transcoder:

```
vidispine::transcoder {"http://transcoder1:8080/":
  ensure     => present,
  vshostname => 'localhost',
  vsport     => 8080,
  vsuser     => 'admin',
  vspass     => 'admin',
  trans_addr => 'http://transcoder1',
  trans_port => 8080,
}
```

## Reference

### Types

The module contains custom types which are backed by a provider that communicates
with Vidispine through its REST API. Each custom type is wrapped in a defined type,
i.e. `vidispine_storage` has a wrapper deftype `vidispine::storage`.

As is standard for any Puppet module:
* Custom types can be found under `lib/puppet/type`
* Defined types can be found in `manifests`
* Providers can be found under `lib/puppet/provider`

Parameters shared by all types:
* `vshostname`: The hostname of the Vidispine instance (always 'localhost' as the
  Puppet agent runs on the host it is managing)
* `vsport`: The HTTP port of the Vidispine API, usually 8080
* `vsuser`: A username with admin privileges on the Vidispine instance (always 'admin')
* `vspass`: The password for the admin account

There is a potential enhancement here, to set these parameters centrally.

Each type is ensurable (`ensure => present` or `ensure => absent` can be set).

For more a more in-depth explanation of what each of these resources will affect within
Vidispine itself, please refer to the corresponding section of the Vidispine
[API documentation](http://apidoc.vidispine.com/latest/).

####Â `vidispine_storage`, `vidispine::storage`

Define a storage backend.

`name`: The name of the storage.

Vidispine API: http://apidoc.vidispine.com/latest/storage/storage.html

#### `vidispine_storage_method`, `vidispine::storage_method`

Define methods by which to reach an existing storage.

`storageuri`: The URI at which the storage can be reached (see API doc for supported protocols)

`location`: The name of the storage that this method applies to (this should match
the name of the corresponding `vidispine::storage` resource)

`read`, `write`, `browse`: boolean flags - refer to API doc.

`type`: The storage type - refer to API doc.

Vidispine API: http://apidoc.vidispine.com/latest/storage/storage.html

#### `vidispine_system_field`, `vidispine::system_field`

System fields are simple key-value pairs that configure Vidispine. Note that you can 
set any system field; Vidispine will not reject values that it doesn't know about, but
only values that are known will have an effect on the application.

`name`: The name of the system field

`value`: The value of the system field

Vidispine API: http://apidoc.vidispine.com/latest/system/property.html

#### `transcoder_address`, `vidispine::transcoder`

`trans_addr`: The hostname or IP address of the transcoder

`trans_port`: The TCP port of the transcoder

#### `vidispine_thumbnails`, `vidispine::thumbnails`

Set up a thumbnail resource. The name of the resource should be the path to the thumbnails.

`name`: The path to the thumbnails as a URL, e.g. `file:///opt/vidispine/thumbnails`

Please see the Vidispine 
[API documentation](http://apidoc.vidispine.com/latest/system/thumbnails.html) for details.

#### `vidispine_import_setting`, `vidispine::import_setting`

This appears to be unused.

## Limitations

* Only known to work on Ubuntu 12.04. Should also work on 14.04 with minimal changes.
* Certain edge cases are known to break the custom types.
* Custom types do not implement prefetching, making Puppet runs very slow and very
  'chatty' with the Vidispine API
* There is not yet a way to centrally specify `vshostname`, `vsport`, `vsuser`, `vspass`
* The module does not handle the installation of the Vidispine license
* Errors from the Vidispine API are not handled or reported
* Type conversion and validation of parameters is wrong in many places
